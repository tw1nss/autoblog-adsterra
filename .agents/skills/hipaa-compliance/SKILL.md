# HIPAA Compliance

Implement HIPAA Security Rule, Privacy Rule, and Breach Notification Rule requirements for systems that create, receive, maintain, or transmit electronic Protected Health Information (ePHI).

## When to Use

- Building or operating systems that handle electronic Protected Health Information
- Configuring cloud infrastructure for HIPAA-eligible workloads
- Establishing Business Associate Agreements with vendors
- Implementing technical safeguards for PHI protection
- Preparing for HIPAA compliance audits or OCR investigations

## Best Practices

- Conduct a thorough risk analysis annually and after significant system changes
- Use only HIPAA-eligible cloud services and sign BAAs before deploying PHI workloads
- Encrypt all PHI at rest and in transit with no exceptions
- Implement the minimum necessary standard: grant access only to the PHI needed for each role
- Maintain audit logs of all PHI access for a minimum of 6 years
- Train all workforce members on HIPAA policies at onboarding and annually
- Test contingency plans (backup restore, DR failover, emergency access) at least annually
- Track all Business Associate Agreements in a central registry with review dates
- Document every addressable specification decision (implement, alternative, or not applicable with rationale)
- Prepare breach notification templates and procedures before an incident occurs
