# ISO 27001 Compliance

Implement an Information Security Management System (ISMS) aligned with ISO/IEC 27001:2022.

## When to Use

- Establishing an ISMS for the first time in an organization
- Preparing for ISO 27001 certification audit
- Conducting risk assessments and developing risk treatment plans
- Creating the Statement of Applicability (SoA)
- Transitioning from ISO 27001:2013 to the 2022 revision
- Meeting customer or regulatory requirements for ISO 27001 certification

## ISMS Plan-Do-Check-Act Cycle

```yaml
pdca_cycle:
  plan:
    - Define ISMS scope and boundaries
    - Establish information security policy
    - Conduct risk assessment
    - Develop risk treatment plan
    - Produce Statement of Applicability
    - Obtain management approval and commitment
    - Define security objectives and metrics

  do:
    - Implement selected Annex A controls
    - Deploy technical security controls
    - Conduct security awareness training
    - Document all procedures and processes
    - Implement incident management process
    - Establish supplier security management

  check:
    - Conduct internal audits (at least annual)
    - Perform management review meetings
    - Monitor and measure control effectiveness
    - Review incident trends and near misses
    - Assess compliance with legal requirements
    - Evaluate security metrics against objectives

  act:
    - Address nonconformities with corrective actions
    - Implement continual improvement initiatives
    - Update risk assessment based on changes
    - Refine controls based on audit findings
    - Communicate improvements to stakeholders
```

    risk_formula: "Risk = Likelihood x Impact"
    scale: "1-5 for both likelihood and impact (total 1-25)"

  likelihood_scale:
    1: "Rare - less than once per 5 years"
    2: "Unlikely - once per 2-5 years"
    3: "Possible - once per 1-2 years"
    4: "Likely - multiple times per year"
    5: "Almost Certain - monthly or more frequent"

  impact_scale:
    1: "Negligible - minimal operational impact, no data loss"
    2: "Minor - limited impact, small data exposure, <$10K cost"
    3: "Moderate - significant impact, data breach <1K records, <$100K cost"
    4: "Major - severe impact, large data breach, <$1M cost, regulatory action"
    5: "Critical - catastrophic, massive breach, >$1M cost, business viability at risk"

  risk_matrix:
    #        Impact: 1    2    3    4    5

```

## Best Practices

- Secure visible management commitment with a signed information security policy
- Define ISMS scope carefully; too broad makes certification expensive, too narrow reduces value
- Use an asset-based risk assessment approach to ensure comprehensive coverage
- Maintain the Statement of Applicability as a living document aligned with the risk register
- Conduct internal audits with auditors independent of the area being audited
- Hold management review meetings quarterly rather than only annually
- Integrate ISO 27001 controls into daily operations rather than treating them as a separate compliance exercise
- Use metrics and KPIs to demonstrate ISMS effectiveness to auditors and management
- Plan for the 3-year certification cycle: certification audit, then two surveillance audits
- Start collecting evidence of control operation at least 3 months before the Stage 2 audit
