# PCI DSS Compliance

Implement PCI DSS v4.0 requirements for protecting cardholder data across the Cardholder Data Environment (CDE), including network segmentation, encryption, access controls, and ongoing testing.

## When to Use

- Processing, storing, or transmitting payment card data
- Scoping the Cardholder Data Environment for PCI assessment
- Selecting the appropriate Self-Assessment Questionnaire (SAQ)
- Implementing network segmentation to reduce CDE scope
- Preparing for QSA assessment or ASV scanning

## SAQ Types and Applicability

```yaml
saq_types:
  SAQ_A:
    description: "Card-not-present merchants using fully outsourced payment"
    applies_when:
      - All payment processing fully outsourced to PCI-compliant third party
      - No electronic storage, processing, or transmission of cardholder data
      - Only payment page redirects or iframes from compliant provider
    requirements: ~22 questions

  SAQ_A_EP:
    description: "E-commerce merchants with website that affects payment security"
    applies_when:
      - E-commerce channel only
      - Website controls redirect to or loads payment page from third party
      - No direct processing but website could affect transaction security
    requirements: ~191 questions

  SAQ_B:
    description: "Merchants with only imprint machines or standalone terminals"
    applies_when:
      - Only standalone POS terminals (dial-out or IP connected)
      - No electronic cardholder data storage
      - No e-commerce channel
    requirements: ~41 questions

  SAQ_C:
    description: "Merchants with payment application systems connected to internet"
    applies_when:
      - Payment application connected to internet
      - No electronic cardholder data storage
      - No e-commerce channel
    requirements: ~160 questions

  SAQ_D:
    description: "All other merchants and all service providers"
    applies_when:
      - Stores cardholder data electronically
      - Does not fit any other SAQ type
      - Service providers eligible for SAQ D
    requirements: "Full set of PCI DSS requirements"

  scope_reduction_strategies:
    - Use tokenization to replace PAN with non-sensitive tokens
    - Use P2PE (Point-to-Point Encryption) validated solutions
    - Outsource payment processing to reduce your CDE footprint
    - Implement network segmentation to isolate CDE
```

## Encryption and Tokenization

```yaml
encryption_requirements:
  stored_data_req_3:
    pan_encryption:
      algorithm: AES-256
      mode: GCM (preferred) or CBC with HMAC
      key_storage: HSM or dedicated key management service
      never_store:
        - Full track data (magnetic stripe)
        - CVV/CVC/CAV2
        - PIN / PIN block

    pan_display_masking:
      rule: "Show maximum first 6 and last 4 digits"
      examples:
        masked: "4111 11** **** 1111"
        acceptable_for_business: "First 6 and last 4"
      implementation: "Apply masking at application layer before rendering"

    key_management_req_3_6:
      - Generate keys using approved random number generator
      - Protect keys with key-encrypting keys (KEKs)
      - Store key components separately (split knowledge, dual control)
      - Rotate keys at least annually (or per crypto period)
      - Retire and replace keys when compromised
      - Document key custodian responsibilities

  transmission_req_4:
    protocols:
      required: "TLS 1.2 or higher"
      prohibited: "SSL, TLS 1.0, TLS 1.1"
    cipher_suites:
      preferred:
        - TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384
        - TLS_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256
      minimum: "128-bit key strength"
    certificate_management:
      - Use certificates from trusted CAs
      - Verify hostname and certificate validity
      - Monitor certificate expiration

  tokenization_strategy:
    description: "Replace PAN with non-reversible token to reduce CDE scope"
    implementation:
      - Use format-preserving tokens (same length/format as PAN)
      - Token vault in isolated CDE segment
      - Token-to-PAN mapping encrypted and access-controlled
      - De-tokenization requires authenticated API call
      - Log all de-tokenization requests
    scope_benefit: "Systems using only tokens are out of PCI scope"
```

## Vulnerability Management and Testing

```bash
# Req 11.3 - Internal vulnerability scanning (quarterly minimum)
# Using OpenVAS or Nessus

## Best Practices

- Minimize CDE scope aggressively using tokenization, P2PE, and outsourced payment processing
- Use network segmentation to isolate the CDE and reduce the number of in-scope systems
- Never store sensitive authentication data (CVV, track data, PIN) after authorization
- Implement MFA for all access into the CDE, not just remote access (v4.0 requirement)
- Automate vulnerability scanning and patch management to maintain continuous compliance
- Deploy file integrity monitoring on all CDE systems to detect unauthorized changes
- Synchronize clocks across all CDE systems using NTP for accurate log correlation
- Conduct internal and external penetration tests annually and after significant changes
- Review all firewall and security group rules semi-annually with documented business justification
- Maintain a current data flow diagram showing all cardholder data transmission and storage points
