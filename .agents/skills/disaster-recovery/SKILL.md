# Disaster Recovery

Implement disaster recovery strategies including RTO/RPO planning, AWS cross-region failover patterns, DR testing procedures, and automated failover scripts.

## When to Use

- Defining RTO and RPO targets for critical systems
- Designing multi-region or multi-cloud disaster recovery architectures
- Implementing automated failover and failback procedures
- Conducting DR tests (tabletop, component, full failover)
- Meeting compliance requirements for contingency planning (SOC 2, HIPAA, FedRAMP, ISO 27001)

## RTO/RPO Planning

```yaml
recovery_metrics:
  RTO:
    definition: "Recovery Time Objective - maximum acceptable downtime"
    measurement: "From incident declaration to service restoration"
    factors:
      - Failover automation maturity
      - Data replication lag
      - DNS propagation time
      - Application warm-up time
      - Verification procedures

  RPO:
    definition: "Recovery Point Objective - maximum acceptable data loss"
    measurement: "Time gap between last good backup and the incident"
    factors:
      - Backup frequency
      - Replication method (sync vs. async)
      - Transaction log shipping interval
      - Cross-region replication lag

service_tier_targets:
  tier_1_critical:
    examples: "Authentication, payment processing, core API"
    rto: "< 15 minutes"
    rpo: "< 1 minute (near-zero)"
    strategy: "Multi-site active-active or warm standby"
    replication: "Synchronous or near-synchronous"
    testing: "Quarterly failover test"

  tier_2_essential:
    examples: "Customer dashboards, reporting, notifications"
    rto: "< 1 hour"
    rpo: "< 15 minutes"
    strategy: "Warm standby or pilot light"
    replication: "Asynchronous with short interval"
    testing: "Semi-annual failover test"

  tier_3_standard:
    examples: "Internal tools, analytics, batch processing"
    rto: "< 4 hours"
    rpo: "< 1 hour"
    strategy: "Pilot light or backup and restore"
    replication: "Periodic snapshots"
    testing: "Annual failover test"

  tier_4_non_essential:
    examples: "Development environments, documentation sites"
    rto: "< 24 hours"
    rpo: "< 24 hours"
    strategy: "Backup and restore"
    replication: "Daily backups"
    testing: "Annual backup restore verification"
```

## DR Strategies Comparison

```yaml
strategies:
  backup_and_restore:
    rto: "Hours"
    rpo: "Hours (depends on backup frequency)"
    cost: "$"

    aws_services:
      - "S3 cross-region replication for backups"
      - "RDS automated snapshots copied to DR region"
      - "AMI copies in DR region"
      - "Terraform/CloudFormation for infrastructure rebuild"
    pros: "Lowest cost, simplest to maintain"
    cons: "Longest recovery time, highest data loss potential"

  pilot_light:
    rto: "Minutes to hours"
    rpo: "Minutes"
    cost: "$$"
    description: "Core infrastructure running in DR region (databases replicated). Scale up compute on failover."
    aws_services:

      - "AMIs pre-built in DR region"
      - "Auto Scaling groups at zero/minimal capacity"
    pros: "Fast database recovery, moderate cost"
    cons: "Compute scale-up adds to recovery time"

  warm_standby:
    rto: "Minutes"
    rpo: "Seconds to minutes"
    cost: "$$$"
    description: "Scaled-down but functional environment in DR region. Scale up on failover."

      - "Route53 health checks for automated DNS failover"
      - "Global Accelerator for traffic management"
    pros: "Fast failover, reduced risk"
    cons: "Higher baseline cost for idle resources"

  multi_site_active:
    rto: "Near-zero"
    rpo: "Near-zero"
    cost: "$$$$"
    description: "Active-active across regions. Traffic served from both regions simultaneously."
    aws_services:

    - [ ] DR strategy selected based on targets and budget
    - [ ] DR architecture documented with diagrams
    - [ ] Failover and failback runbooks written
    - [ ] Communication plan for DR events documented
    - [ ] DR roles and responsibilities assigned

    - [ ] DNS failover routing configured
    - [ ] DR region infrastructure provisioned (IaC)
    - [ ] Monitoring and alerting configured in DR region
    - [ ] Secrets and credentials available in DR region

  testing:
    - [ ] Tabletop exercises conducted quarterly
    - [ ] Component failover tests conducted monthly
    - [ ] Full failover test conducted annually
    - [ ] Actual RTO/RPO measured and compared to targets
    - [ ] Test results documented and reviewed
    - [ ] Runbooks updated based on test findings

  operational:
    - [ ] Replication lag monitored with alerting
    - [ ] DR environment health checked regularly
    - [ ] Backup integrity verified monthly
    - [ ] DR runbooks reviewed and updated quarterly
    - [ ] DR test evidence archived for compliance audits
```

## Best Practices

- Define RTO and RPO targets based on business impact analysis, not technical convenience
- Choose the DR strategy that matches your targets and budget: do not over-engineer or under-invest
- Automate failover as much as possible to reduce human error and recovery time
- Test DR procedures regularly at increasing levels of complexity (tabletop, component, full)
- Measure actual RTO and RPO during tests and compare against targets every time
- Include failback procedures in your DR plan: getting back to normal is as important as failing over
- Monitor replication lag continuously and alert when it exceeds RPO thresholds
- Keep DR infrastructure managed by the same IaC as production to prevent configuration drift
- Practice DR in non-emergency conditions so the team is prepared when a real disaster occurs
- Archive DR test results as compliance evidence for SOC 2, HIPAA, and other frameworks
