## BCP Maintenance Checklist

```yaml
bcp_maintenance_checklist:
  quarterly:
    - [ ] Contact lists verified and updated
    - [ ] Tabletop exercise conducted
    - [ ] BCP team roster reviewed
    - [ ] Vendor contact information verified
    - [ ] Communication channels tested

  semi_annually:
    - [ ] Functional exercise conducted
    - [ ] Recovery procedures reviewed for accuracy
    - [ ] Technology dependencies verified
    - [ ] Vendor continuity capabilities confirmed

  annually:
    - [ ] Full-scale exercise conducted
    - [ ] Business Impact Analysis refreshed
    - [ ] Risk assessment updated
    - [ ] BCP document fully reviewed and updated
    - [ ] Executive review and sign-off obtained
    - [ ] Training completed for all BCP team members
    - [ ] Lessons learned from all exercises incorporated

  triggered_by_change:
    - [ ] New critical business process added
    - [ ] Major organizational restructuring
    - [ ] Technology platform migration
    - [ ] New regulatory requirement
    - [ ] Significant vendor change

```

## Best Practices

- Secure executive sponsorship: BCP without leadership commitment will not be taken seriously
- Base recovery priorities on Business Impact Analysis, not assumptions or technical preferences
- Test the communication plan independently: it fails more often than the technology recovery
- Maintain contact lists as if your primary systems are unavailable (offline copies, mobile access)
- Conduct tabletop exercises quarterly at minimum: they are low-cost and high-value for identifying gaps
- Include non-IT scenarios in planning (pandemic, facility loss, key personnel unavailability)
- Define clear activation criteria so there is no ambiguity about when to invoke the BCP
- Keep the BCP document practical and actionable, not a shelf document written for auditors
- Update the BCP after every significant organizational or technology change
- Review and incorporate lessons from every exercise and every real event into the plan
