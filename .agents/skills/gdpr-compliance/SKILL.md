# GDPR Compliance

Implement General Data Protection Regulation requirements for organizations that process personal data of EU/EEA residents, covering lawful processing, data subject rights, and technical safeguards.

## When to Use

- Processing personal data of EU/EEA residents in any capacity
- Building consent management and preference centers
- Implementing Data Subject Access Request (DSAR) workflows
- Conducting Data Protection Impact Assessments (DPIAs)
- Setting up data processing agreements with third-party processors
- Designing systems with privacy by design and by default principles

## Key Principles and Legal Bases

```yaml
gdpr_principles:
  article_5:
    lawfulness_fairness_transparency:
      description: "Process data lawfully, fairly, and transparently"
      implementation:
        - Document legal basis for every processing activity
        - Provide clear privacy notices
        - No hidden or deceptive data collection

    purpose_limitation:
      description: "Collect for specified, explicit, and legitimate purposes"
      implementation:
        - Define purpose before collection
        - Do not repurpose data without new legal basis
        - Document all processing purposes in ROPA

    data_minimization:
      description: "Adequate, relevant, and limited to what is necessary"
      implementation:
        - Collect only required fields
        - Review data models for unnecessary fields
        - Remove optional fields that are not used

    accuracy:
      description: "Accurate and kept up to date"
      implementation:
        - Provide self-service profile editing
        - Implement data validation at point of entry
        - Schedule regular data quality reviews

    storage_limitation:
      description: "Kept no longer than necessary"
      implementation:
        - Define retention periods per data category
        - Automate deletion when retention expires
        - Document retention schedule

    integrity_and_confidentiality:
      description: "Appropriate security measures"
      implementation:
        - Encryption at rest and in transit
        - Access controls and audit logging
        - Pseudonymization where appropriate

    accountability:
      description: "Demonstrate compliance"
      implementation:
        - Maintain Records of Processing Activities
        - Conduct DPIAs for high-risk processing
        - Appoint DPO if required

legal_bases:
  article_6:
    consent: "Freely given, specific, informed, unambiguous"
    contract: "Necessary for performance of a contract"
    legal_obligation: "Required by EU or member state law"
    vital_interests: "Protect life of data subject or another person"
    public_interest: "Task carried out in public interest"
    legitimate_interest: "Legitimate interest not overridden by data subject rights"
```

## Data Subject Access Request (DSAR) Procedures

```yaml
dsar_workflow:
  step_1_receive:
    actions:
      - Log the request with timestamp and channel received
      - Assign unique tracking ID
      - Acknowledge receipt within 3 business days
    identity_verification:
      - Verify identity before providing any data
      - Use existing authentication where possible
      - Request additional proof if necessary (but not excessive)
    sla: "Must respond within 30 days (extendable to 90 days for complex requests)"

  step_2_assess:
    actions:
      - Determine request type (access, rectification, erasure, portability, etc.)
      - Identify all systems containing the individual's data
      - Check for lawful grounds to refuse (legal obligations, etc.)
      - Assess if extension is needed (complex or numerous requests)

  step_3_collect:
    systems_to_search:
      - Primary application database
      - CRM system
      - Email marketing platform
      - Analytics systems
      - Customer support tickets
      - Backup systems (if practically retrievable)
      - Log files containing PII
      - Third-party processors (request from each)

  step_4_respond:
    access_request:
      - Provide copy of all personal data in commonly used electronic format
      - Include processing purposes, categories, recipients, retention periods
      - Include source of data if not collected from the individual
      - Include information about automated decision-making
    rectification_request:
      - Update data in all systems
      - Notify all recipients of the correction
    erasure_request:
      - Delete data from all active systems
      - Remove from backups where technically feasible
      - Notify all processors and recipients
      - Document what was deleted and any retained data with legal basis
    portability_request:
      - Provide data in structured, machine-readable format (JSON/CSV)
      - Include only data provided by the data subject
      - Transfer directly to another controller if requested and feasible

  step_5_close:
    actions:
      - Send response to data subject
      - Document the entire handling process
      - Archive DSAR record for accountability
      - Update data mapping if new data stores discovered

## Best Practices

- Maintain a comprehensive Records of Processing Activities as the foundation of GDPR compliance
- Implement privacy by design: build data protection into systems from the start, not retrofitted
- Apply data minimization rigorously: do not collect personal data "just in case"
- Automate DSAR processing to meet the 30-day response deadline consistently
- Keep consent granular and purpose-specific; avoid bundled consent for multiple purposes
- Conduct DPIAs before launching high-risk processing activities
- Ensure data processing agreements are signed with every processor before sharing personal data
- Implement automated retention enforcement to prevent storage beyond defined periods
- Train all staff who handle personal data, not just the IT and legal teams
- Regularly audit data flows to discover shadow processing or undocumented data stores
