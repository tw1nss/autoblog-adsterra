# Change Management

Implement structured change management processes covering change classification, CAB workflows, emergency change procedures, and automation for compliance with SOC 2, ITIL, and regulatory frameworks.

## When to Use

- Establishing change management processes for production environments
- Implementing change advisory board (CAB) workflows
- Defining change classification and approval requirements
- Configuring automated change tracking in CI/CD pipelines
- Handling emergency changes with proper controls and documentation

## Change Classification

```yaml
change_types:
  standard:
    risk: Low
    approval: Pre-approved (no per-change approval needed)
    lead_time: None (within maintenance window)
    examples:
      - Routine patching within tested patch sets
      - Certificate rotation with established procedure
      - Scaling operations (adding/removing instances within limits)
      - Pre-approved configuration changes
      - Log rotation and archival
    requirements:
      - Change must match an approved Standard Change template
      - Automated testing must pass
      - Documented rollback procedure exists
      - Within defined maintenance window

  normal_low:
    risk: Low
    approval: Peer review (1 approver)
    lead_time: 2 business days
    examples:
      - Non-critical configuration changes
      - Feature flag toggles
      - Documentation updates to production systems
      - Adding monitoring dashboards or alerts

  normal_medium:
    risk: Medium
    approval: Team lead + peer review (2 approvers)
    lead_time: 5 business days
    examples:
      - Application deployments with new features
      - Database schema changes (non-breaking)
      - Network rule modifications
      - Integration endpoint changes
      - Dependency version upgrades

  normal_high:
    risk: High
    approval: CAB review required
    lead_time: 10 business days
    examples:
      - Infrastructure migrations
      - Breaking database schema changes
      - Major version upgrades (OS, runtime, database engine)
      - Changes to authentication or authorization systems
      - Multi-service coordinated deployments
      - Changes affecting data processing or compliance controls

  emergency:
    risk: Variable
    approval: Emergency CAB (minimum 2 approvers from on-call)
    lead_time: None (immediate implementation)
    examples:
      - Security vulnerability remediation (active exploitation)
      - Production outage resolution
      - Data integrity emergency fixes
      - Regulatory compliance deadline fixes
    requirements:
      - Retroactive full documentation within 48 hours
      - Post-implementation review required
      - CAB retroactive review at next meeting
```

## Change Management Metrics

```yaml
metrics:
  change_success_rate:
    description: "Percentage of changes implemented without rollback or incident"
    target: ">95%"
    formula: "(successful changes / total changes) * 100"

  emergency_change_rate:
    description: "Percentage of changes classified as emergency"
    target: "<5%"
    formula: "(emergency changes / total changes) * 100"

  rollback_rate:
    description: "Percentage of changes that required rollback"
    target: "<3%"

  mean_time_to_implement:
    description: "Average time from approval to implementation"
    target: "Varies by type"

  cab_approval_time:
    description: "Average time from submission to CAB decision"
    target: "<5 business days for normal changes"
```

## Change Management Checklist

```yaml
change_management_checklist:
  process_setup:
    - [ ] Change types defined with classification criteria
    - [ ] Approval matrix documented (who approves what)
    - [ ] CAB established with regular meeting schedule
    - [ ] Emergency change procedure documented
    - [ ] Change request template created
    - [ ] Change freeze policy defined

  tooling:
    - [ ] PR template includes change management fields
    - [ ] Automated risk classification in CI/CD
    - [ ] Branch protection enforces required approvals
    - [ ] Deployment records captured automatically
    - [ ] Change audit trail preserved (PR history, approvals)

  compliance:
    - [ ] All production changes have documented approval
    - [ ] Rollback plans exist for every change
    - [ ] Post-implementation reviews conducted for failures
    - [ ] Emergency changes documented retroactively within 48 hours
    - [ ] Change metrics reported monthly
    - [ ] Audit trail retained for compliance period (1-3 years)
```

## Best Practices

- Classify changes by risk level to apply proportionate controls without slowing low-risk work
- Automate risk classification based on files changed, services affected, and deployment scope
- Use PR approvals as the native change approval mechanism for code-driven changes
- Require rollback plans for every change and test rollback procedures periodically
- Track emergency changes as a key metric: a high rate indicates systemic process issues
- Implement change freezes during critical business periods to protect stability
- Conduct post-implementation reviews for all failed changes to drive improvement
- Separate duty of implementation from duty of approval (no self-approving changes)
- Capture deployment records automatically in CI/CD rather than relying on manual entry
- Keep the CAB focused on high-risk decisions; do not bottleneck low-risk changes through CAB
