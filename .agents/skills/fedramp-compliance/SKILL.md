# FedRAMP Compliance

Implement FedRAMP (Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program) requirements for cloud service providers serving US federal agencies.

## When to Use

- Pursuing FedRAMP authorization for a cloud service offering
- Implementing NIST 800-53 security controls for federal workloads
- Establishing continuous monitoring (ConMon) processes
- Managing Plan of Action and Milestones (POA&M) tracking
- Preparing for a Third-Party Assessment Organization (3PAO) audit
- Operating a FedRAMP-authorized system and maintaining authorization

## Impact Levels

```yaml
impact_levels:
  low:
    control_count: ~125
    use_case: "Publicly available federal information"
    examples:
      - Public-facing websites with no sensitive data
      - Open data portals
      - Marketing and informational systems
    data_types: "No PII, no CUI, publicly releasable only"
    authorization_path: "FedRAMP Tailored (Li-SaaS) or standard Low"

  moderate:
    control_count: ~325
    use_case: "Most federal systems, including CUI"
    examples:
      - Email and collaboration platforms
      - Case management systems
      - Financial management systems
      - HR and personnel systems
    data_types: "CUI, PII, law enforcement sensitive (LES)"
    authorization_path: "Agency or JAB P-ATO"
    note: "~80% of FedRAMP authorizations are at Moderate"

  high:
    control_count: ~425
    use_case: "High-impact federal systems"
    examples:
      - Law enforcement and criminal justice systems
      - Emergency services and public safety
      - Financial systems with significant impact
      - Healthcare systems with PHI
    data_types: "Classified-adjacent, life-safety, critical infrastructure"

## FedRAMP FIPS 140-2 Cryptography Requirements

```bash
# Verify FIPS mode is enabled on Linux systems
cat /proc/sys/crypto/fips_enabled
# Output should be: 1

# Check OpenSSL FIPS module
openssl version
openssl list -providers  # Should show FIPS provider

# AWS: Use FIPS endpoints
# Example: Use FIPS endpoint for S3
aws s3 ls --endpoint-url https://s3-fips.us-east-1.amazonaws.com

# Configure AWS CLI for FIPS
# ~/.aws/config
# [default]
# use_fips_endpoint = true

# Verify TLS configuration meets FedRAMP requirements
openssl s_client -connect your-service.example.com:443 -tls1_2 < /dev/null 2>/dev/null | \
  grep -E "Protocol|Cipher"
# Must be TLS 1.2 or higher with FIPS-approved cipher suites
```

## FedRAMP Authorization Checklist

```yaml
authorization_checklist:
  pre_authorization:
    - [ ] Determine impact level (Low, Moderate, High)
    - [ ] Choose authorization path (Agency ATO or JAB P-ATO)
    - [ ] Engage FedRAMP PMO for readiness assessment
    - [ ] Select 3PAO from FedRAMP marketplace
    - [ ] Complete SSP with all control implementations documented
    - [ ] Develop required policies and procedures
    - [ ] Implement all applicable NIST 800-53 controls
    - [ ] Ensure FIPS 140-2 validated cryptographic modules in use

  assessment:
    - [ ] 3PAO conducts readiness assessment (optional but recommended)
    - [ ] 3PAO conducts full security assessment
    - [ ] 3PAO delivers Security Assessment Report (SAR)
    - [ ] Develop POA&M for all findings
    - [ ] Remediate critical and high findings before authorization

  authorization_package:
    - [ ] System Security Plan (SSP)
    - [ ] Security Assessment Report (SAR)
    - [ ] Plan of Action and Milestones (POA&M)
    - [ ] Continuous Monitoring Plan
    - [ ] Incident Response Plan
    - [ ] Contingency Plan
    - [ ] Configuration Management Plan
    - [ ] Control Implementation Summary (CIS)
    - [ ] Interconnection Security Agreements

  post_authorization:
    - [ ] Establish ConMon program with monthly deliverables
    - [ ] Monthly vulnerability scanning and POA&M updates
    - [ ] Annual 3PAO assessment of control subset
    - [ ] Annual penetration testing
    - [ ] Report significant changes to authorizing official
    - [ ] Report security incidents to US-CERT within 1 hour
    - [ ] Maintain authorization by meeting ConMon requirements
```

## Best Practices

- Start with a FedRAMP Readiness Assessment to identify gaps before the formal 3PAO assessment
- Use the FedRAMP SSP template exactly as provided to avoid review delays
- Inherit controls from your IaaS provider (AWS GovCloud, Azure Government) and document the inheritance clearly
- Implement FIPS 140-2 validated cryptographic modules for all encryption (TLS, at-rest, key management)
- Automate continuous monitoring deliverables to reduce manual effort and human error
- Maintain POA&M items within aging thresholds; overdue items risk losing authorization
- Report significant system changes to the authorizing official before implementation
- Treat the SSP as a living document and update it with every change to the system boundary
- Use US-CERT reporting procedures and maintain the 1-hour incident notification requirement
- Engage the FedRAMP PMO early and often for guidance on the authorization process
