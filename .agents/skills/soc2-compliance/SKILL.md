# SOC 2 Compliance

Implement SOC 2 Trust Services Criteria controls, evidence collection, and continuous compliance monitoring for Type I and Type II audits.

## When to Use

- Preparing for a SOC 2 Type I or Type II audit
- Mapping existing controls to Trust Services Criteria
- Automating evidence collection for auditor requests
- Building continuous compliance monitoring into CI/CD
- Onboarding new services and ensuring SOC 2 control coverage

## Continuous Compliance Monitoring

```yaml
# GitHub Actions workflow for continuous SOC 2 checks
name: SOC2 Compliance Checks
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 6 * * 1'  # Weekly on Monday
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  access-review:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Check MFA enforcement
        run: |
          USERS_WITHOUT_MFA=$(aws iam generate-credential-report && sleep 5 && \
            aws iam get-credential-report --output text --query Content | \
            base64 -d | awk -F, '$4=="true" && $8=="false" {print $1}')
          if [ -n "$USERS_WITHOUT_MFA" ]; then
            echo "::error::Users without MFA: $USERS_WITHOUT_MFA"
            exit 1
          fi

      - name: Check for unused credentials

      - name: Verify CloudTrail is logging
        run: |
          STATUS=$(aws cloudtrail get-trail-status --name org-audit-trail --query 'IsLogging' --output text)
          [ "$STATUS" = "True" ] || (echo "::error::CloudTrail logging stopped" && exit 1)

      - name: Check GuardDuty is enabled
        run: |
          DETECTOR=$(aws guardduty list-detectors --query 'DetectorIds[0]' --output text)
          [ "$DETECTOR" != "None" ] || (echo "::error::GuardDuty not enabled" && exit 1)
```

## Best Practices

- Start with a gap assessment to understand current control maturity before engaging an auditor
- Automate evidence collection to reduce the burden of auditor requests and ensure consistency
- Map each control to a specific tool, owner, and evidence artifact for traceability
- Implement continuous monitoring rather than point-in-time checks for Type II readiness
- Maintain a central evidence repository organized by control criteria
- Conduct quarterly internal reviews to catch control drift before the audit period
- Keep policies living documents with version history and annual review dates
- Train all employees on their role in maintaining SOC 2 controls
- Use the audit preparation timeline to avoid last-minute scrambling
- Treat each auditor exception as an improvement opportunity rather than a failure
