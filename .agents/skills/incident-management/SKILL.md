# Incident Management

Implement effective incident management processes including severity definitions, escalation matrices, war room procedures, and blameless post-mortem templates.

## When to Use

- Establishing incident management processes for production systems
- Defining severity levels and escalation procedures
- Running war rooms and coordinating incident response
- Conducting blameless post-incident reviews
- Building on-call schedules and notification workflows
- Meeting compliance requirements for incident response (SOC 2, HIPAA, PCI DSS)

## Severity Levels

```yaml
severity_definitions:
  SEV1_critical:
    impact: "Complete service outage or data breach affecting all/most customers"
    examples:
      - Production site completely down
      - Data breach confirmed or suspected
      - Complete loss of a critical business function
      - Security incident with active exploitation
    response_time: "Immediate (within 5 minutes)"
    update_frequency: "Every 15-30 minutes"
    who_is_paged: "On-call engineer, engineering manager, incident commander, executive on-call"
    communication: "Status page update, customer email, executive notification"
    resolution_target: "< 1 hour to mitigate"

  SEV2_major:
    impact: "Major feature broken or severe degradation affecting many customers"
    examples:
      - Key feature completely non-functional
      - Significant performance degradation (>5x latency)
      - Data processing pipeline completely stalled
      - Partial outage affecting a region or segment
    response_time: "Within 15 minutes"
    update_frequency: "Every 30-60 minutes"
    who_is_paged: "On-call engineer, engineering manager"
    communication: "Status page update if customer-facing"
    resolution_target: "< 4 hours to mitigate"

  SEV3_moderate:
    impact: "Minor feature impaired or degradation affecting some customers"
    examples:
      - Non-critical feature broken
      - Moderate performance degradation
      - Elevated error rate (below threshold for SEV2)
      - Single-customer impact on non-critical function
    response_time: "Within 1 hour during business hours"
    update_frequency: "Every 2-4 hours"
    who_is_paged: "On-call engineer"
    communication: "Internal only unless customer inquires"
    resolution_target: "< 1 business day"

  SEV4_low:
    impact: "Cosmetic issue, minor inconvenience, or non-customer-facing problem"
    examples:
      - UI cosmetic bug
      - Non-critical monitoring gap
      - Internal tool degradation
      - Documentation inaccuracy in production
    response_time: "Next business day"
    update_frequency: "As needed"
    who_is_paged: "None (ticket created)"
    communication: "None"
    resolution_target: "Within sprint planning cycle"
```

**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD
**Severity:** SEV[1-4]
**Duration:** [Start time] to [End time] ([X hours Y minutes])
**Incident Commander:** [Name]
**Author:** [Name]
**Status:** Draft / In Review / Final

## Executive Summary
[2-3 sentence summary of what happened, the impact, and the resolution]

## Impact
- **Customer impact:** [Number/percentage of customers affected, what they experienced]
- **Duration of impact:** [How long customers were affected]
- **Revenue impact:** [Estimated financial impact, if applicable]
- **Data impact:** [Any data loss or corruption]
- **SLA impact:** [Any SLA breaches]

## Timeline (all times UTC)
| Time | Event |
|------|-------|
| HH:MM | [First anomaly detected by monitoring] |
| HH:MM | [Alert fired / customer report received] |
| HH:MM | [On-call engineer acknowledged] |
| HH:MM | [Incident declared at SEV level] |
| HH:MM | [War room established] |
| HH:MM | [Root cause identified] |
| HH:MM | [Mitigation applied] |
| HH:MM | [Service restored] |
| HH:MM | [Incident resolved] |

## Root Cause
[Detailed technical explanation of what caused the incident]

## Detection
- **How was the incident detected?** [Monitoring alert / customer report / manual observation]

- **Could we have detected sooner?** [Yes/No, with explanation]

## Response
- **What went well:**
  - [List things that worked effectively during response]
  - [E.g., "Runbook for database failover was accurate and followed successfully"]
  - [E.g., "Communication to customers was timely and clear"]

- **What could be improved:**
  - [List things that slowed or hindered response]
  - [E.g., "Took 20 minutes to identify the correct service owner"]
  - [E.g., "Monitoring did not alert on the specific failure mode"]

## Contributing Factors

1. [Factor 1: e.g., "Configuration change was not tested in staging"]
2. [Factor 2: e.g., "Alert threshold was too high to catch gradual degradation"]
3. [Factor 3: e.g., "No circuit breaker between Service A and Service B"]

## Incident Management Checklist

```yaml
incident_management_checklist:
  process_setup:
    - [ ] Severity levels defined with clear criteria
    - [ ] Escalation matrix documented
    - [ ] On-call schedule established and staffed
    - [ ] War room procedures documented
    - [ ] Post-mortem template created
    - [ ] Communication templates prepared (status page, email)
    - [ ] Incident management tool configured (PagerDuty, OpsGenie)

  per_incident:
    - [ ] Incident declared with severity level
    - [ ] War room established (SEV1/2)
    - [ ] Roles assigned (IC, comms, technical lead, scribe)
    - [ ] Timeline maintained in real-time
    - [ ] Status page updated (customer-facing impact)
    - [ ] Stakeholders notified per communication plan
    - [ ] Resolution verified with monitoring
    - [ ] Post-mortem scheduled
    - [ ] Post-mortem conducted and published
    - [ ] Action items tracked to completion

  compliance:
    - [ ] All SEV1/2 incidents have post-mortems
    - [ ] Incident log maintained for audit evidence
    - [ ] Metrics reported monthly
    - [ ] On-call health monitored (pages per person)
    - [ ] Annual incident response training conducted
    - [ ] Annual incident response plan test completed
```

## Best Practices

- Define severity levels with concrete examples so there is no ambiguity during an active incident
- Implement time-based escalation: if the on-call does not acknowledge, automatically escalate
- Focus on mitigation first, root cause second: restore service before investigating why it failed
- Run blameless post-mortems: the goal is to improve systems, not to assign fault to individuals
- Track post-mortem action items to completion: an unfinished action item means the same incident can recur
- Monitor incident metrics (MTTR, MTTD, frequency) as leading indicators of system reliability
- Protect on-call health: track page volume per person and redistribute if someone is overburdened
- Separate the incident commander role from the technical lead role in SEV1/2 incidents
- Practice incident response regularly with game days or chaos engineering exercises
- Archive incident records and post-mortems for compliance evidence and organizational learning
