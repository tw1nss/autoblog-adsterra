## Example Runbook — Database Failover

````markdown
# Runbook: PostgreSQL Database Failover

**Owner:** Platform / DBA team
**Last Reviewed:** 2025-06-15
**Version:** 2.1
**Severity if unavailable:** SEV1

---

## Overview

Failover the primary PostgreSQL instance to the synchronous replica when
the primary is unreachable or degraded. This runbook covers both planned
(maintenance) and unplanned (emergency) failover.

## Prerequisites

- [ ] DBA or SRE-level access to primary and replica hosts
- [ ] `psql` client installed (v14+)
- [ ] VPN connected to production network
- [ ] Slack channel #db-ops open
- [ ] Confirm replica is in sync: replication lag < 1 MB

## Procedure

### Step 1 — Verify Replica Health

```bash
psql -h replica.db.internal -U dba -d postgres -c \
  "SELECT pg_is_in_recovery(), pg_last_wal_replay_lsn();"
```

**Expected output:** `pg_is_in_recovery = t`, LSN advancing.

### Step 2 — Stop Application Writes

```bash
kubectl scale deployment api-server --replicas=0 -n production
kubectl scale deployment worker --replicas=0 -n production
```

**Expected output:** Deployments scaled to 0 pods.

### Step 3 — Confirm Write Quiesce

```bash
psql -h primary.db.internal -U dba -d postgres -c \
  "SELECT count(*) FROM pg_stat_activity WHERE state = 'active' AND query !~ 'pg_stat';"
```

**Expected output:** Count = 0 (no active queries).

### Step 4 — Promote Replica

```bash
psql -h replica.db.internal -U dba -d postgres -c "SELECT pg_promote();"
```

Wait up to 30 seconds, then confirm:

```bash
psql -h replica.db.internal -U dba -d postgres -c "SELECT pg_is_in_recovery();"
```

**Expected output:** `pg_is_in_recovery = f` (no longer a replica).

### Step 5 — Update DNS

```bash
aws route53 change-resource-record-sets \
  --hosted-zone-id Z1234567890 \
  --change-batch '{
    "Changes": [{
      "Action": "UPSERT",
      "ResourceRecordSet": {
        "Name": "db.internal.example.com",
        "Type": "CNAME",
        "TTL": 60,
        "ResourceRecords": [{"Value": "replica.db.internal"}]
      }
    }]
  }'
```

### Step 6 — Restart Application

```bash
kubectl scale deployment api-server --replicas=6 -n production
kubectl scale deployment worker --replicas=4 -n production
```

## Verification

- [ ] `psql -h db.internal.example.com -c "SELECT 1;"` returns successfully
- [ ] Application logs show successful DB connections (no errors for 5 min)
- [ ] Transaction throughput returns to baseline on Grafana dashboard
- [ ] No replication-lag alerts firing

## Rollback

If the promoted replica has issues, restore from the most recent backup:

```bash
# Restore latest automated snapshot (RDS example)
aws rds restore-db-instance-from-db-snapshot \
  --db-instance-identifier prod-db-restored \
  --db-snapshot-identifier prod-db-latest-snapshot
```

## Escalation

If unresolved after 15 minutes:
- **Primary:** @dba-lead — +1-555-0101
- **Secondary:** @platform-oncall — +1-555-0102

  - [ ] Links to dashboards and docs are valid (not broken)
```

## Runbook Testing Procedures

```yaml
testing_strategy:
  dry_run:
    frequency: "Every time a runbook is created or substantially edited"
    method: "Walk through each step in a staging environment"
    goal: "Verify commands work and output matches documentation"

  peer_review:
    frequency: "Every edit"
    method: "Another engineer follows the runbook in staging without help"
    goal: "Confirm the runbook is self-contained and unambiguous"

  scheduled_validation:
    frequency: "Quarterly"
    method: "SRE team picks 5 runbooks at random, executes in staging"
    goal: "Catch runbooks that have drifted from production reality"

  incident_triggered:
    trigger: "Any time a runbook is used in a real incident"
    method: "Post-mortem includes runbook accuracy assessment"
    goal: "Capture improvements while the experience is fresh"

  automation_testing:
    method: "CI pipeline validates bash scripts with shellcheck and dry-run"
    example: |
      # .github/workflows/runbook-lint.yml
      name: Lint Runbook Scripts
      on: [pull_request]
      jobs:
        shellcheck:
          runs-on: ubuntu-latest
          steps:
            - uses: actions/checkout@v4
            - name: ShellCheck
              run: |
                find runbooks/ -name "*.sh" -exec shellcheck {} +
```

## Versioning Strategy

```yaml
versioning:
  storage: "Git repository — one directory per service, one file per runbook"
  naming: "runbooks/<service>/<operation>.md"
  branching: "PRs required for all changes; reviewed by service owner"

  version_scheme:
    format: "MAJOR.MINOR"
    major_bump: "Procedure changes that alter the steps or their order"
    minor_bump: "Clarifications, typo fixes, updated contact info"

  directory_layout: |
    runbooks/
      api-server/
        deploy.md
        rollback.md
        scale-up.md
      database/
        failover.md
        backup-restore.md
        vacuum-maintenance.md
      infrastructure/
        dns-update.md
        certificate-renewal.md
        disk-cleanup.md

  review_requirements:
    - PR must be approved by the service owner
    - CI must pass (shellcheck for scripts, markdown lint)
    - Reviewer confirms they can follow the steps independently

  retention: "Git history serves as full audit trail — never delete old versions"
```

## Runbook Index Template

Keep a top-level index so engineers can find the right runbook quickly.

```markdown
# Runbook Index

| Service | Runbook | Severity | Owner | Last Tested |
|---------|---------|----------|-------|-------------|
| API Server | [Deploy](api-server/deploy.md) | — | @platform | 2025-05-01 |
| API Server | [Rollback](api-server/rollback.md) | SEV1 | @platform | 2025-05-01 |
| Database | [Failover](database/failover.md) | SEV1 | @dba | 2025-04-15 |
| Database | [Backup Restore](database/backup-restore.md) | SEV2 | @dba | 2025-04-15 |
| Infra | [DNS Update](infrastructure/dns-update.md) | SEV2 | @sre | 2025-06-01 |
| Infra | [Cert Renewal](infrastructure/certificate-renewal.md) | SEV3 | @sre | 2025-06-01 |
```

## Best Practices

- Write runbooks for the engineer at 3 AM — clear, sequential, copy-pasteable
- Include expected output so the operator knows if a step succeeded
- Always provide a rollback path; every action should be reversible
- Test runbooks in staging before they are needed in production
- Keep runbooks in version control alongside the code they support
- Assign an owner to every runbook; ownerless runbooks rot fast
- After every incident, update the relevant runbook with lessons learned
- Automate repetitive runbook steps into scripts, but keep the runbook as
  the orchestration guide so operators understand the "why"
